## How to help the project?

### Translate the application

Translations are managed at Transifex, please contribute there at https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/openpgp-keychain/

### Contribute Code

1. Join the development mailinglist at http://groups.google.com/d/forum/openpgp-keychain-dev
2. Lookout for interesting issues on our issue page at Github: https://github.com/openpgp-keychain/openpgp-keychain/issues
3. Tell us about your plans on the mailinglist
4. Read this README, especially the notes about coding style
5. Fork OpenKeychain and contribute code (the best part ;) )
6. Open a pull request on Github. I will help with occuring problems and merge your changes back into the main project.

I am happy about every code contribution and appreciate your effort to help us developing OpenKeychain!

## Development

Development mailinglist at http://groups.google.com/d/forum/openpgp-keychain-dev

### Build with Gradle

1. Have Android SDK "tools", "platform-tools", and "build-tools" directories in your PATH (http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
2. Open the Android SDK Manager (shell command: ``android``).  
Expand the Tools directory and select "Android SDK Build-tools (Version 19.0.3)".  
Expand the Extras directory and install "Android Support Repository"  
Select everything for the newest SDK (API-Level 19)
3. Export ANDROID_HOME pointing to your Android SDK
4. Execute ``./gradlew build``
5. You can install the app with ``adb install -r OpenPGP-Keychain/build/apk/OpenPGP-Keychain-debug-unaligned.apk``

### Build API Demo with Gradle

1. Follow 1-3 from above
2. Change to API Demo directory ``cd OpenPGP-Keychain-API``
3. Execute ``./gradlew build``

### Development with Android Studio

I am using the newest [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html) for development. Development with Eclipse is currently not possible because I am using the new [project structure](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio-tips.html).

1. Clone the project from github
2. From Android Studio: File -> Import Project ->  ...
  * Select the cloned top folder if you want to develop on the main project
  * Select the "OpenPGP-Keychain-API" folder if you want to develop on the API example
3. Import project from external model -> choose Gradle

## OpenKeychain's API

OpenKeychain provides two APIs, namely the Intent API and the Remote OpenPGP API.
The Intent API can be used without permissions to start OpenKeychain's activities for cryptographic operations, import of keys, etc.
However, it always requires user input, so that no malicious application can use this API without user intervention.  
The Remote OpenPGP API is more sophisticated and allows to to operations without user interaction in the background.
When utilizing this API, OpenKeychain asks the user on first use to grant access for the calling client application.

More technical information and examples about these APIs can be found in the project's wiki:  
* [Intent API](https://github.com/openpgp-keychain/openpgp-keychain/wiki/Intent-API)
* [Remote OpenPGP API](https://github.com/openpgp-keychain/openpgp-keychain/wiki/OpenPGP-API)


## Libraries


### ZXing Barcode Scanner Android Integration

Classes can be found under "libraries/zxing-android-integration/".

1. Checkout their SVN (see http://code.google.com/p/zxing/source/checkout)
2. Copy all classes from their android-integration folder to our library folder

### ZXing

Classes can be found under "libraries/zxing/".
ZXing classes were extracted from the ZXing library (https://github.com/zxing/zxing).
Only classes related to QR Code generation are utilized.

### Bouncy Castle

#### Spongy Castle

Spongy Castle is the stock Bouncy Castle libraries with a couple of small changes to make it work on Android. OpenKeychain uses a forked version with some small changes. These changes will been sent to Bouncy Castle, and Spongy Castle will be used again when they have filtered down.

## Notes

### Gradle Build System

We try to make our builds as [reproducible/deterministic](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/deterministic-builds-part-one-cyberwar-and-global-compromise) as possible.  
When changing build files or dependencies, respect the following requirements:
* No precompiled libraries. All libraries should be provided as sourcecode in "libraries" folder (you never know what pre-compiled jar files really contain! The library files are currently directly commited, because git submodules/git subtree are too much of a hassle for new contributors. This could change in the future!)
* No dependencies from Maven (also a soft requirement for inclusion in [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org))
* Always use a fixed Android Gradle plugin version not a dynamic one, e.g. ``0.7.3`` instead of ``0.7.+`` (allows offline builds without lookups for new versions, also some minor Android plugin versions had serious issues, i.e. [0.7.2 and 0.8.1](http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system))
* Commit the corresponding [Gradle wrapper](http://www.gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) to the repository (allows easy building for new contributors without the need to install the required Gradle version using a package manager)
* In order to update the build system to a newer gradle version you need to:
  * Update every build.gradle file with the new gradle version and/or gradle plugin version
    * build.gradle
    * OpenPGP-Keychain/build.gradle
    * OpenPGP-Keychain-API/build.gradle
    * OpenPGP-Keychain-API/example-app/build.gradle
    * OpenPGP-Keychain-API/libraries/keychain-api-library/build.gradle
  * run ./gradlew wrapper twice to update gradle and download the new jar file
  * commit the new jar and property files

### Translations

Translations are hosted on Transifex, which is configured by ".tx/config".

1. To pull newest translations install transifex client (e.g. ``apt-get install transifex-client``)
2. Config Transifex client with "~/.transifexrc"
3. Go into root folder of git repo
4. execute ``tx pull`` (``tx pull -a`` to get all languages)

see http://help.transifex.net/features/client/index.html#user-client

## Coding Style

### Code
* Indentation: 4 spaces, no tabs
* Maximum line width for code and comments: 100
* Opening braces don't go on their own line
* Field names: Non-public, non-static fields start with m.
* Acronyms are words: Treat acronyms as words in names, yielding !XmlHttpRequest, getUrl(), etc.

See http://source.android.com/source/code-style.html

### XML Eclipse Settings
* XML Maximum line width 999
* XML: Split multiple attributes each on a new line (Eclipse: Properties -> XML -> XML Files -> Editor)
* XML: Indent using spaces with Indention size 4 (Eclipse: Properties -> XML -> XML Files -> Editor)

See http://www.androidpolice.com/2009/11/04/auto-formatting-android-xml-files-with-eclipse/

### Automated syntax check with CheckStyle

####Linux
1. Paste the `tools/checkstyle.xml` file to `~/.AndroidStudioPreview/config/codestyles/`
2. Go to Settings > Code Style > Java, select OpenPgpChecker, as well as Code Style > XML and select OpenPgpChecker again.
3. Start code inspection and see the results by selecting Analyze > Inspect Code from Android-Studio or you can directly run checkstyle via cli with `.tools/checkstyle`. Make sure it's executable first.

####Mac OSX
1. Paste the `tools/checkstyle.xml` file to `~/Library/Preferences/AndroidStudioPreview/codestyles`
2. Go to Preferences > Code Style > Java, select OpenPgpChecker, as well as Code Style > XML and select OpenPgpChecker again.
3. Start code inspection and see the results by selecting Analyze > Inspect Code from Android-Studio or you can directly run checkstyle via cli with `.tools/checkstyle`. Make sure it's executable first.

####Windows
1. Paste the `tools/checkstyle.xml` file to `C:\Users\<UserName>\.AndroidStudioPreview\config\codestyles`
2. Go to File > Settings > Code Style > Java, select OpenPgpChecker, as well as Code Style > XML and select OpenPgpChecker again.
3. Start code inspection and see the results by selecting Analyze > Inspect Code from Android-Studio.
