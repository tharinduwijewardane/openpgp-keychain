<h2>How can I specify connection port for Keyserver?</h2>
<p>Add a new Keyserver (or modify existing one) by going to Preferences -> General -> Keyservers. Enter the port number after the Keyserver address and preceded it by a colon. For example, "p80.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80" (without quotation marks) means that server "p80.pool.sks-keyservers.net" is working on a port 80.</p>
<p>Default connection port is 11371 and it doesn't need to be specified.</p>
